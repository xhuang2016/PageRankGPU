## Overview
This repository provides the C++ and CUDA implementations of the PageRank algorithm.

The repository is organized as follows:
* ```CPU/```: CPU implementation of PageRank.
* ```GPU/```: GPU implementation of PageRank, including pull-based, push-based, and edge-based implementations.

> Note:
> 
> CPU code and GPU code should be complied with `g++` and 'nvcc', respectively.
> 
> Datasets can be downloaded from [SNAP](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html).
